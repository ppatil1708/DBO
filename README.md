#DBO1D_Codes

We present codes to solve stochastic partial differential equations using the dynamically/bi-orthonormal method. For more details about the results please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04299)

**Case I: Stochastic linear advection equation**

**Case II: Stochastic Burgers' equation with manufactured solution** 

**Case III: Burgers' equation with stochastic forcing**
