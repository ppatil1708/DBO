#DBO1D_Codes

We present codes to solve stochastic partial differential equations using the dynamically/bi-orthonormal method. For more details about the results please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04299)

**Case I: Stochastic linear advection equation**

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + V(\omega) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 &&x \in [0, 2\pi] \quad \mbox{and} \quad  t\in[0,t_f],\\$$
$$          u(x,0) &= \sin(x), &&x \in [0, 2\pi]$$

**Case II: Stochastic Burgers' equation with manufactured solution** 

**Case III: Burgers' equation with stochastic forcing**
